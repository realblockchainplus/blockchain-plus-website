      "sectionLang": {
        "what-is-blockchain-plus": {
          "question": "What is Blockchain+ ?",
          "answer": "Blockchain+ is a next-generation distributed database."
        },
        "open-source": {
          "question": "Are you open source?",
          "answer": "Yes. All of Blockchain+’s code is open source."
        },
        "permissioned": {
          "question": "Are you a permissioned blockchain?",
          "answer": "Blockchain+ is not a permissioned blockchain. In our opinion, permissioned blockchains (where a central authority controls the operation) go against the very fabric of blockchains. Blockchain’s should be distributed and open!"
        },
        "consortium": {
          "question": "Are you then a Consortium blockchain?",
          "answer": "Blockchain+ can be defined as a consortium because we limit our membership numbers. However, unlike traditional consortiums where membership is closed to the general public, everyone has the opportunity to be part of our network. Our members can vote to change the parameters by which future members can join be part of our network."
        },
        "infrastructure": {
          "question": "How hackable is Blockchain+’s infrastructure?",
          "answer": "Assuming a very minimum Blockchain+ network configuration of 5000 regular and 5000 partner nodes the minimum odds required to perform fraudulent activity is 1 in 99,990,000. With this minimum configuration the odds of performing fraudulent transaction is 923 times more than getting stuck with lightning in a given year. These odds are further mitigated by the fact that (a) BlockChain+ will be open-source, meaning bugs and security breaches will be reported and fixed faster; (b) BlockChain+ will be operating on a global network, which means the number of nodes will be much higher than above assumed ones which means odds will increase exponentially; and (c) the BlockChain+ Partner node community will be performing extensive tasks regularly, such as bad node reporting, random algorithm generation, and certification issuing and revoking. Thus the risk can be further reduced much more."
        },
        "validation": {
          "question": "How does Blockchain+ validate transactions?",
          "answer": "In blockchain at very least every block is joined with other blockchain using hash however in blockchain+ we use hash to store transaction details in validating nodes. So essentially if you validated someone else`s transaction you will store hash of data which cannot be decrypted but can be used later to validate that the transaction you validated is legitimate. The hashes are stored in redundancy to provide data integrity."
        },
        "different-ethereum": {
          "question": "How is Blockchain+ different from Ethereum?",
          "answer": "Blockchain+ is an attempt to create synergies by marrying public and private blockchains. Any public blockchain, including Ethereum, faces long term operational issues because transactions are settled by appending information to one massive blockchain. This architecture makes the database bulkier over time compromising speed and reducing the ability to effectively execute transactions long term. Blockchain+ will be implementing Ethereum’s smart contract feature long-term. Smart contracts are a genius concept!"
        },
        "different-ripple": {
          "question": "How is Blockchain+ different from Ripple?",
          "answer": "Ripple is a permissioned blockchain which fundamentally goes against the grain of blockchains. Blockchain+ avoids the traditional permissioned based architecture by randomly selecting the nodes validating the transaction. Blockchain+ uses random number teleportation to generate a same random number on all nodes without transmitting to each other."
        },
        "jellyfishes": {
          "question": "What's up with Jellyfishes?",
          "answer": "The core of Blockchain+’s random number generator relies on chaos theory. Chaotic behaviour occurs in natural systems like weather, climate and movements of jellyfish among many others. The wildly random jellyfish movements are just a start as Blockchain+ will be integrating many more chaotic elements to its random number generator."
        }
      }
    },
    "random-number": {
      "headerTitle": "Random Number Teleportation",
      "headerDescription": "We generate random numbers via movements of jellyfishes in aquariums around the world. The number is then consumed by each and every node to generate another set of random number using ever changing algorithms and configuration data. The final random numbers are generated in such a way that they are impossible to predict, are purely random and same on all nodes without transmitting to each other.",
